# NSS promotion screen frontend
This is the frontend for the NSS promotion application. It is a vanilla JavaScript project, build with Vite.

## Installation
To run the application, make sure that NodeJS is installed. Install all dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Available npm commands
`npm run dev`: starts the Vite development server (as the name suggests: only for development)
`npm run build`: builds the application into the `dist` folder. This application can then be served with any professional webserver.

## TODO
Currently the backend url is hardcoded in the script. It would be nice if we can configure this in a professional way, without having to change the source code everytime. Please investigate this by looking the Vite documentation.
