### 2. Containerization of the Applications

## Overview

For this requirement, the goal was to containerize the entire NSS Thermometer application, which includes:
- **Backend:** A Laravel application.
- **Frontend:** A static web application served by Nginx.
- **Database:** A PostgreSQL instance.
- **Seeder Script:** A script to seed the backend with initial data.

Containerization is achieved using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**. This approach ensures that the application is portable, scalable, and easy to manage, while also allowing us to leverage environment variables for flexible configuration.
